    Then I check the response status code to be 201

    Then I verify the response status code is 200
  
  Scenario: Perform PATCH request
    When I execute a PATCH request to "/users/2" with the payload
    Then I validate the response status code is 200
  
  Scenario: Perform DELETE request

    Then I ensure the response status code is 204
